When I am on a creators page and use the 'back' button on my phone instead of using the 'x' to close the page, the feed is unable to scroll.

On the creators page it says 'plaforms' instead of 'platforms'


Some items seems to lack horizontal padding.

Go to creators -> a creator -> go back in your browser (not the close button in the view) and bam webpage broken.

When in the creators view, the search bar label says “search for games”.

It would be nice to see the total games count when filtering.

Viewing a game (the game modal) doesn’t let me see the bottom content, as my browser bottom bar covers it.

404 not found if you refresh when on a game page.

After clicking next page, the next page button is still in a “clicked” state, making it seem disabled.

Next button should be on the right, and previous on the left.
